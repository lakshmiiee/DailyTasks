<p><i>Arguably one of the best actors south Asia has produced in recent history, the Malayalam movie star has evolved with the times, but he could have done better.

SERGIUS: I am surprised at myself, Louka. What would Sergius, the hero of Slivnitza, say if he saw me now? What would Sergius, the apostle of the higher love, say if he saw me now? What would the half dozen Sergiuses who keep popping in and out of this handsome figure of mine say if they caught us here?” — “Arms and the Man” by George Bernard Shaw

History has been kind to Mohanlal. When he arrived in the Malayalam film industry in 1980, the scene was ‘clash of the titans’. Sweet rogues such as MG Soman and Sukumaran were at the peak of their careers. In fact, their presence looked so formidable then that there was hardly any room left for a newbie dilettante like Mohanlal, who neither had the looks nor the skills to make the cut in the star-lit industry. Just to put things in perspective, just in 1980, Soman acted in more than two dozen films and Sukumaran did more than 20 films.

Mohanlal’s entry flick, Manjil Virinja Pookal, a romantic thriller produced by Navodaya Appachan and directed by Fazil, did reasonably well at the box office but his role was nowhere near the ones that would make him famous in the later years. And that year, he didn’t release any other movies. But 1981 saw nearly eight movies by Mohanlal hit the theatres. In 1982, nearly a dozen films came to the cinemas with his credit and the next year, he almost doubled the tally. Ever since, there has been no looking back.
