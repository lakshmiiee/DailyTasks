<h1><a href="details.html"> Air India stops flights to Europe, 5 destinations in US, Canada including New York, Newark, Washington DC, Chicago, and Toronto</h1></a>
<p>
Air India has stopped flying to Europe and five cities in the U.S. and Canada because of growing tensions in the Middle East. Flights by Air India Express and IndiGo going to the Middle East have also been affected, with some being diverted to other airports.The situation worsened after Iran launched a missile attack on a US military base in Qatar. In response, some countries, including Qatar, shut down their airspace, making it harder for airlines to fly over the region.</p>
