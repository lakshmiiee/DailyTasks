Hi!
Good day! 

</p>
<p>
I just want to know why the date that appears when I'm on the article page or when I open or read the article is "today's date" and not the published date. However, if I just visit the blog page and don't open the article, the published date of the article is displayed there. How can I change this? What do I need to do?

Thank you
