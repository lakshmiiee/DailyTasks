<p >Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish originating in South Asia, made with rice, meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef) or seafood (prawns or fish), and spices. To cater to vegetarians, the meat or seafood can be substituted with vegetables or paneer.[1][2] Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.[3]
Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora. Similar dishes are also prepared in many other countries like Iraq and Malaysia, and was often spread to such places by South Asian diaspora populations.[4][5] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.</p>
