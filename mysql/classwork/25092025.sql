-- You are setting up a simple online system for a small grocery shop. Your task is to:
-- Create a new database called GroceryShop.
-- Use that database.
-- Create a table named products with the following details:
-- product_id (number, should be the main identifier)
-- product_name (text)
-- price (number)
-- Later, you are asked to add a new column called category (text) to the same table.
-- The shop owner wants to remove all items from the products table without deleting the table itself.
-- Finally, delete the entire database as itâ€™s no longer needed.

CREATE DATABASE grocery shop;

use `grocery shop`;

CREATE TABLE products(product_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
product_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
price INT(5) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY (product_id));

ALTER TABLE products ADD category VARCHAR(20);

TRUNCATE TABLE products;

DROP DATABASE `grocery shop`;
