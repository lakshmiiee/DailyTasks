	You are building a simple birthday tracker for your friends. You need to:
Create an object named friend with properties: name and birthDate (in the format YYYY-MM-DD).


Write a function getBirthdayDetails that:


Accepts the friend object as input,


Converts the birthDate string into a date,


Extracts and prints the year, month name, and day of the month,


Calculates how many years old the friend is as of today.


Display the result in the format:
 "John was born on 5 July, 1999 and is 25 years old."
